A test project where I scraped some data off reddit and put it through some basic nlp models to get
word frequency, top companies mentioned and top people mentioned - followed this guy's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpIi4HtCiVk&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst

also made a wordcloud to have a visual representation of the top words mentioned

I have another repository where I did the same but with comments, it's basically the same thing just tweaked the PRAW to scrape comments
instead of posts.

Things to do(for the comment repository): Put comments through sentiment analysis model to have an overview of general sentinment about
the post.

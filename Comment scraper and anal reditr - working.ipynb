      ">: Technicals for  $ G M E  stock  indicate a rising Relative Strength Index, a positive flip beginning with the Schaff Trend Cycle, and a double bottom clearly shown in the chart.  We have a visual rebound that is pure green over 5 days, with statistical outliers on the high end- showing that any gain in price has not yet taken hold.  Ortex data shows SI% maxed out for a historic 30 days in a row, a 138% increase in reported-only short-interest over a period of 4 months.  Options activity is on the rise again, with calls jumping ahead of puts in a 1.84:1 ratio.  Implied Volatility supports are rising with a shown historical discount in IV based on historical peaks (currently 0.95 versus 2.1) meaning call options are very discounted here but demand is beginning for them.  And finally, the 15 month price is $225.00 per share, which shows the stock is now at a 58.2% discount to the split-range.\n",

The data is now revealing that we are only just getting started with a new and unique \"March-April 2022 GameStop short squeeze.\"  Short-selling hedge funds have not covered yet - at all.

You cannot be more selfish and intergalactically-stupid than the boomers who were responsible for these policies.  There clearly exists that generation of 'Baby Boomers' who are responsible for Congressional insider stock trading, egregious financial exploitation of other classes through real estate, significant humanitarian violations and abuse of societal authority during the pandemic, and decades of fraud and corruption via the abuse of the stock market.  For anybody who cares, it's definitely time for the younger and healthier America to lead the country in a better direction, while reestablishing integrity-only policies across all branches of Government.\n",

      "To go back to your question about what you can do with an NFT that you can't do with a database, here are my thoughts for a business case on NFTs.  NFTs could be used to authenticate whatever you want in the future (games, in-game purchases such as skins/dances/emoticons?/weapons/etc., in addition real life things that get counterfeited such as artwork, sports memorabilia, shoes, expensive handbags, jewelry, watches, etc.  Basically whenever you buy something, you want to make sure what you're buying is authentic and not a cheap knock off.  NFT's can serve that purpose and be linked to an item like a certificate of authenticity during a sale.  NFT's can not be counterfeited AFAIK since they're minted on the blockchain by the originator.  There would be no need for a database to track NFTs since it can be tracked via the blockchain.  You can look back on the blockchain and trace the transaction all the way back to the originator.  A database is OK if there's someone to keep one up to date.  How would that be done for so many transactions? I'm not even sure companies care to keep databases of subsequent transactions past the first buyer.  I think NFTs would make perfect sense for this purpose.  Maybe one day the Gamestop NFT would expand past the gaming market and sell all these real items with NFTs.  There's a hint of this since you can go on to the gamestop online shop and buy a whole lot more than games.\n",

Once Melvin has COVERED his margin call by ADDING FUNDS he was free to do whatever he wished with that portfolio, including a portfolio swap with big brother. Big brother (whoever stepped up) with their nigh-infinite funds where no longer at risk of a margin call and Melvin had officially COVERED his short position.\\n\\nAny more questions?

In the \"buy to cover\" example that was discussed above, the investor could choose to close the position by delivering the shares or they could let it run knowing that they now hold the shares to cover it. The act of covering does not necessarily mean closing the position.

NFTs could be used to authenticate whatever you want in the future (games, in-game purchases such as skins/dances/emoticons?/weapons/etc., in addition real life things that get counterfeited such as artwork, sports memorabilia, shoes, expensive handbags, jewelry, watches, etc.  Basically whenever you buy something, you want to make sure what you're buying is authentic and not a cheap knock off.  NFT's can serve that purpose and be linked to an item like a certificate of authenticity during a sale.  NFT's can not be counterfeited AFAIK since they're minted on the blockchain by the originator.  There would be no need for a database to track NFTs since it can be tracked via the blockchain.  You can look back on the blockchain and trace the transaction all the way back to the originator.  A database is OK if there's someone to keep one up to date.  How would that be done for so many transactions? I'm not even sure companies care to keep databases of subsequent transactions past the first buyer.  I think NFTs would make perfect sense for this purpose.  Maybe one day the Gamestop NFT would expand past the gaming market and sell all these real items with NFTs.  There's a hint of this since you can go on to the gamestop online shop and buy a whole lot more than games.\", 'Do I believe in the MOASS theory?\\n-so you’re backtracking your claim?
